        <p>The rise of SKCT to prominence over its thirty five years of existence is primarily attributed to its mission to accomplish expectations of the society and industry by nurturing the students to be competent professionals with integrity, besides profound technical knowledge and skill. In rethinking education to deal with rapid changes at the dawn of the twenty-first century, innovation, technology, and research are indispensable tools of education. As we are quite aware, education is central to the knowledge-based society that derives from human potential.

I invite you to explore the treasure within you through outstanding teaching, choice based credit system, and a wide range of academic programs and extra-curricular offerings which SKCT has.
